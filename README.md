# Seiko_SKX007

Today I just bought my first watch in life. It is a Seiko SKX007 Automatic watch.
I am learning front-end coding, so I decide to make a quick HTML/Javascript sketch for my Seiko SKX007.

I will add more functions later, such as light-off to show the lumes on the watch, buttom to rotate its bazel, and draw its bracelet.
